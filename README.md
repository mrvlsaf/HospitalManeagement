# HospitalManeagement
A short project on hospital management using graphics and classes in C++.
I made this project in 12th standard by myself using graphics.h.
Fortis is a hospital near me so I used it's name and it's nothing else.
I ran this program on Turbo c++ back in 2017. But now as graphics file 
is not linked with most of moduar IDEs like devc++ or sublime text or coding blocks 
you may need to set that externally.
If you find my project unique than thank you.
Happy Coding.
